1) In this code, I am tracking which files are opened by different process.
I am using 'tracepoint/syscall/sys_enter_open' to track opened files. map is an array and value is string.

Following command can be used to look for kprobe symbols
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_filter_function

list of tracepoints:
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls
Important:
While kprobes hook into kernel function entries, Tracepoints (specifically sys_enter_openat) are the official, stable interface for monitoring syscalls initiated by user-space applications
